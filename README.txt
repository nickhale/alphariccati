These codes reproduce the results in HALE, ThOMANN, and WEIDEMAN - 
APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS TO A NONLINER FUNCTIONAKL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

The code relies on 
 * Chebfun (barymat, legpts, plus some other functions) 
   (https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun)
 * alignfigs() 
   (https://github.com/nickhale/alignfigs)
although the last is used only for nice formatting of the results.
